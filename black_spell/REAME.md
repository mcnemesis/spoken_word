the black spell
===============

This is the first piece in this collection of works, and it's meant to set the bar for quality and direction of the other works.

This particular work is a spell - both metaphorically and literaly!

Purpose
--------

The purpose of this work is to awaken the masses consuming HipHop out there - to inspire them, edutain them and provoke constructive thought in them.

Mechanics
---------

The work illustrates and executes that purpose when read, performed or studied, and thus the spell is executed.


Recording
---------

It's been a while since I last hit a real-studio to record a track, but this is an awakening of sorts hopefully. This particular work (as will many others in this collection), are to be
produced and recorded under unordinary conditions, to ensure that they preserve the quality of the artform and effect the best audio & mental experience possible. 

For these reasons, am yet to identify which local producer can undertake this work, and also find the funds to execute this production work in the manner suited to the work.

Am keeping open the possibility of obtaining help from HipHop ethusiasts out there - producers, fellow emcees, kultural gurus, rap geniuses and other elite and lovers of the artform.

A kickstater for the project might be a plausible idea, but am yet to determine how best to approach that path.


License
----------

This is an 0-pen-Source work (as are all the works to occur in this collection). This means, the original lyric associated with thi work is available for others to fork and re-adapt as they see fit, under the limitations of the attached Open-Source License.

Derivative works (whether poetic written forms or audio remixes) are encouraged and welcome, under the expected limitations.

I hope this makes a template for future collaborative poetic work and collaborative musical artforms.

Collaborating emcees make a cypher!
